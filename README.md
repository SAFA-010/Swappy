### Project Description
Swappy is an intuitive platform designed to facilitate product swapping among students. No logins required‚Äîjust swap and meet!

### The Problem Statement
Students often find themselves with extra items or things they no longer need, but struggle to find a good place to exchange them. We‚Äôre solving the hassle of buying new products by creating an easy way to swap items with others.

### The Solution
Swappy allows students to directly swap their items with others. You can simply post what you want to swap, browse available products, find a match, and meet up to complete the exchange. It‚Äôs efficient and eco-friendly!
